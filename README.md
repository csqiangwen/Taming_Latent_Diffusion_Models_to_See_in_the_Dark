  An extremely low-light real-world image from SID Dataset (https://cchen156.github.io/SID.html) with a Ã—300 amplification ratio. The image processed by our proposed method exhibits clear improvement in structural content, showcasing finer details compared to previous works. The description generated for each image by InstructBLIP (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06500) also suggests that our result provides higher quality to downstream tasks.
